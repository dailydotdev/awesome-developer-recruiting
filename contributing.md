## Adding a New Resource

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- The resource must be specifically relevant to developer or engineer recruiting, not general recruitment.
- Use the following format: `[Name](URL) - Description.`
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and end with a period.
- Descriptions should start with a capital letter.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should include a clear title and a short note on why the resource belongs in this list.

## Updating Your Pull Request

If the maintainers notice anything that needs to change before merging, we will ask you to edit your pull request. There is no need to open a new one. Please follow the suggestions in [this guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on how to update a pull request.

## What We Are Looking For

- Tools that are actively maintained and used in developer recruiting.
- Free resources that are useful to tech recruiters.
- Research and reports with original data or clear insights.
- Communities with active, engaged membership.
- Content (blogs, podcasts, books) that specifically addresses the nuances of hiring developers.

## What We Are NOT Looking For

- General recruitment tools with no specific developer or tech focus.
- Unmaintained, deprecated, or archived projects.
- Resources behind full paywalls, unless there is a strong reason to include them.
- Affiliate links or marketing content disguised as resources.
- Duplicate entries or tools that replicate an existing entry without clear differentiation.

Thanks for helping improve the list.
